"""Ensemble beat-grid API.

Submit a measure (target duration + >= 2 voices of sound/rest events
with positive rational durations). Durations are accumulated as exact
fractions; a voice that does not fill the target exactly is reported
with its difference and nothing is saved. Valid measures are stored in
SQLite and their beat grid — half-open segments over the union of all
event boundaries — can be queried by id.

Two saved measures can also be looped together (POST /loop-alignments):
the service computes the first instant both loops restart together and
returns the repeated timeline cut at every event boundary, tagged with
each sounding event's original id and its 1-based loop number.
